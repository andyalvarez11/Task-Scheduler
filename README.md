## Description

The Task Scheduler is a web application that allows you to plan and schedule your work day from 9 AM to 5 PM. It provides a clean and user-friendly interface to enter, save, and view your daily events or tasks.

The app dynamically generates time blocks for each hour of the work day and color-codes them to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future. You can enter events for each time block, and your events will be saved in local storage, persisting even when you refresh the page.

## Features

- Display of the current date at the top of the calendar.
- Dynamic generation of time blocks for standard business hours.
- Color-coded time blocks (past, present, and future).
- Ability to enter and save events for each time block.
- Persistence of saved events in local storage.
